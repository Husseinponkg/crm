# Trends Model Retraining Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Insufficient Data**: The retraining was failing because there was only 1 record in the database, which is not enough to train a machine learning model.

2. **Data Type Issues**: The Python script had data type issues with the scipy sparse matrix operations.

3. **Classification Report Issues**: There were issues with generating the classification report due to mismatched class counts.

4. **Poor Error Logging**: The Node.js application wasn't providing detailed error information when the retraining failed.

5. **Data Loading Issues**: The frontend was unable to load the trends data for display in charts.

6. **Large Model Size**: The generated model files were unnecessarily large.

7. **Large Graphs on Frontend**: The charts on the trends dashboard were too large.

8. **Static Customer Count**: The customer count on the GM dashboard was not updating when new customers were added.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Test Data
Created a Python script (`trainer/add_test_data.py`) to add sufficient test data to the database:
- Added 7 test customer records with various services
- This ensures there's enough data for model training

### 2. Fixed Data Type Issues
Modified `trainer/retrain_model.py` to properly handle data types:
- Converted the 'contacts' column to float before creating the sparse matrix
- Used `csr_matrix` to properly create the sparse matrix for numeric features

### 3. Fixed Classification Report Issues
Fixed the classification report generation in `trainer/retrain_model.py`:
- Added proper labels parameter to match the filtered target names
- This prevents the ValueError about mismatched class counts

### 4. Improved Error Logging
Enhanced `controllers/customercontroller.js` to provide better error information:
- Added stdout and stderr capture from the Python process
- Included detailed error output in the rejection message

### 5. Fixed Data Loading Issues
Made several improvements to ensure data loads correctly in the frontend:

1. **Fixed Service Statistics Endpoint**: Modified `getServiceStatistics` function to properly populate customer growth data instead of leaving it as an empty array.

2. **Added File-Based Data Loading**: 
   - Added `loadTrendsDataFromFile()` function to load data directly from `trainer/trends.json`
   - Added `getTrendsDataFromFile()` endpoint accessible at `/api/trends/file`
   - Updated frontend to try the file-based endpoint first, with fallback to database-based endpoint

3. **Updated Frontend**: Modified `public/trends.html` to:
   - Try loading data from `/api/trends/file` first (JSON file)
   - Fall back to `/api/trends` (database) if the file endpoint fails
   - Properly display data in all charts when available

### 6. Reduced Model Size
Optimized the model size in `trainer/retrain_model.py`:
- Reduced the number of trees in the RandomForestClassifier from 100 to 10
- Limited the maximum depth of trees to 5
- Reduced the TF-IDF vectorizer features from 1000 to 100
- This reduced the model size by 88% (from ~107KB to ~13KB)

### 7. Reduced Graph Sizes on Frontend
Made the charts smaller and more compact in `public/trends.html`:
- Reduced padding in chart containers from 20px to 15px
- Reduced margin between charts from 30px to 20px
- Reduced font size of chart titles from 18px to 16px
- Reduced margin below chart titles from 15px to 10px
- Set a maximum width of 500px for chart containers and centered them
- Set a maximum height of 300px for the canvas elements

### 8. Dynamic Customer Count on GM Dashboard
Made the customer count on the GM dashboard update dynamically in `public/gm_dash.html` and `public/js/customer.js`:
- Added `fetchCustomerCount()` function to fetch customer data from the backend
- Added `updateCustomerCount()` function to update the "Total Customers" value on the dashboard
- Added `onCustomerAdded()` function that can be called to refresh the customer count
- Modified the customer.js file to call `window.onCustomerAdded()` when a customer is successfully added
- Set up the GM dashboard to fetch the customer count when the page loads

## Verification

The Python script now runs successfully:
```
python trainer/retrain_model.py
```

Output shows:
- Model retraining completes successfully
- Trends data is generated and saved
- Model is saved as `trainer/customerrands.pkl` (much smaller size)
- Trends data is saved as `trainer/trends.json`

## Testing Instructions

To test the full integration:

1. Ensure the Node.js server is running (typically on port 3000/3001)
2. Make a POST request to `/customer` with customer data:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/customer \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "username": "Test User",
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "contacts": "1234567890",
       "service": "Test Service",
       "details": "This is a test customer for model retraining"
     }'
   ```
3. Check the server logs for successful model retraining messages
4. Verify that `trainer/customerrands.pkl` and `trainer/trends.json` files are updated
5. Visit the trends dashboard at `/trends.html` to see the charts populated with data in a more compact size
6. Visit the GM dashboard at `/gm_dash.html` to see the customer count update when new customers are added

## Future Improvements

1. Consider using SQLAlchemy for better database connectivity in Python
2. Add more robust error handling for different edge cases
3. Implement better data validation before training
4. Consider adding a dedicated endpoint for manual model retraining
5. Add caching mechanism for trends data to improve performance
6. Consider using more efficient model serialization formats
7. Add responsive design for better mobile viewing
8. Add real-time updates using WebSockets for immediate dashboard updates
